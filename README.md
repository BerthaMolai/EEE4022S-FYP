# Geometric vs Learned Implicit Functions
## EEE4022S 2022- Final Year Project
### Bertha Molai

This is a repository containing the core code used for my final year project which was aimed at exploring the use of learned implicit functions like NeRFs for 3D reconstruction.

The project was broken down into two parts: training and mesh extraction. These two steps were taken for a sample lego dataset provided in the original NeRF project and for data collected from a Husky robot.

## Experimentation
For training and mesh extraction of robot dataset, see the Lego folder.

For training and mesh extraction of the robot dataset, see the robot_data folder
